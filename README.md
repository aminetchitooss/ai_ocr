#  OCR (Optical character Recognition)

For this project I use 

* tesseract for ocr

* asiox for ajax requests

* multer for storage upload

* ejs for routes/views


## When uploading an image we are able to:

  > Get the text (with script detection)
  
  > convert it to PDF format


## How to use
  
run these commands 
  
```bash
npm i

npm start

#with nodemon (restart server with every save)
npm run dev

```
